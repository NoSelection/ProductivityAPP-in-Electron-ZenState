# ZenState - Session Change Log

## [2025-12-20] ZenState // Purity Refinement (Minimalist Polish)
- **Viewport Lock**: Refactored the entire application to fit within a single screen. No more scrolling; everything is visible at once.
- **Ultra-Subtle Shadowing**: Replaced heavy drop shadows with high-fidelity, low-opacity borders and hairline depth for a much "cleaner" feel.
- **Micro-Sizing**: Scaled down components (Timer, Focus, Media) to ensure a comfortable fit across standard screen resolutions.
- **Scrollbar Elimination**: Completely removed all scrollbars to achieve a unified, "Command Center" aesthetic.
- **Nebula Softening**: Further refined background cloud opacity and blur for a less distracting, more immersive atmosphere.
- **Mobile Adaptability**: Implemented a smart scrollable stack layout for mobile devices while maintaining the locked single-screen view on desktop.

## [2025-12-20] ZenState // Neural Transformation (UI Redesign)
- **Global Foundation**: Migrated to HSL-based design system for precise color control and better transparency handling.
- **Nebula 2.0**: Implemented a smoother, performance-optimized background with cinematic floating clouds.
- **Cinematic Layout**: Redesigned `Layout.tsx` with a leaner header, refined window controls, and improved bento grid spacing.
- **Core Experience**:
    - `FocusCard`: Immersive mission input with "Neural OS" aesthetic and enhanced interaction states.
    - `Timer`: Minimalist chrono ring with premium tech typography and "Chrono // Active" status monitoring.
- **Component Polish**:

### ⚡ Performance Strike Team
- **GPU Acceleration**: Migrated heavy background mesh animations from CPU to GPU using CSS transforms.
- **Blur Optimization**: Halved backdrop filter radii (40px -> 20px -> 30px with saturate) to significantly reduce CPU load while maintaining premium aesthetics.
- **DDR Hygiene**: Cleaned up unused imports, variables, and linting errors for a production-ready codebase.

### 🌈 Zen-Aura: Vitality & UI Revamp
