# Product Guidelines

## Visual Aesthetic: Organic Minimalism
ZenState should feel like a digital sanctuary. The interface must prioritize clarity, softness, and a sense of natural order.
- **Color Palette:** Soft, muted earth tones, sage greens, and warm grays. High contrast should be used sparingly for essential focus elements.
- **Typography:** Clean, legible sans-serif fonts with generous leading and letter spacing to promote readability and calm.
- **UI Elements:** Rounded corners (high border-radius), subtle drop shadows, and glassmorphism (frosted glass) effects to create depth without clutter.

## Tone of Voice: Zen Master
The application communicates with the wisdom and brevity of a Zen teacher.
- **Style:** Calm, profound, and encouraging.
- **Principles:** Use fewer words. Avoid jargon or aggressive notifications. Every prompt should feel like an invitation to return to the present moment and the task at hand.
- **Example:** Instead of "Task completed! Great job!", use "The seed is planted; the work remains."

## Motion & Interaction: Fluid & Ethereal
Interactions should feel like natural phenomena—like a leaf falling or a ripple in water.
- **Transitions:** Use smooth, organic easing functions (e.g., cubic-bezier with slow entry/exit). Avoid jarring or instant snaps.
- **State Changes:** Elements should fade, breathe, or gently morph between states. The UI should feel like it is exhaling when the user enters a focus session.

## Brand Philosophy: "Find Your Flow"
The core message is that productivity is not about force, but about alignment.
- **Messaging:** Emphasize the "effortless effort" of a deep work state.
- **Goal:** Help the user remove the obstacles to their natural productivity rather than whipping them into action.

## Gamification Philosophy: Gentle Progression
Progression is a reflection of the journey, not a scorecard.
- **XP & Levels:** Rewards and experience points are presented subtly. They serve as a quiet record of time spent in flow.
- **Feedback:** Instead of flashy pop-ups, use gentle visual shifts (e.g., a small plant growing in the corner of the UI) to represent growth and milestones.
